# Project-3

## User Story

- As a blockchain game developer,

- I want to create a P2E game using smart contracts,

- So that players can purchase, bet and win tokens

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given that I want to create an interface that allows players to purchase and use tokens to play retro games,

- When a player wins the game, their tokens will be returned and will receive additional tokens as a reward, but if they lose the contract keeps the tokens,

- Then smart contracts need to be created to allow players to purchase tokens and collect/dispurse tokens if the player wins or loses.
